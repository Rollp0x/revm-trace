//! Core transaction inspector implementation
//! 
//! This module provides the main TxInspector type and its core functionality.
//! The inspector is responsible for tracking and collecting detailed information
//! about transaction execution in the EVM.
//! 
//! # Architecture
//! 
//! The implementation is split across several modules:
//! - `types`: Output and internal data structures
//! - `trace`: Call tracing and error tracking
//! - `inspector`: REVM Inspector trait implementation
//! 
//! # Features
//! 
//! - Complete transaction tracing
//! - Asset transfer tracking (ETH and ERC20)
//! - Call hierarchy reconstruction
//! - Error propagation tracking
//! - Event log collection

/// Core transaction tracing inspector
/// 
/// Provides comprehensive transaction execution tracking by implementing
/// the REVM Inspector trait. Collects detailed information about:
/// 
/// - Asset transfers (ETH and ERC20 tokens)
/// - Contract calls and creations
/// - Call hierarchy and execution paths
/// - Event logs and error states
/// 
/// # State Management
/// 
/// The inspector maintains several internal collections to track execution:
/// - Transfers: Chronological list of all value movements
/// - Call traces: Complete tree of contract interactions
/// - Logs: All emitted events
/// - Call stack: Current execution path
/// - Address stack: Caller context for delegate calls
#[derive(Default, Clone)]

    logs: Vec<Log>,
    /// Stack tracking current position in call hierarchy
    call_stack: Vec<usize>,
    /// Stack maintaining caller context for delegate calls
    address_stack: Vec<Address>,
    /// Stack of pending contract creation transfers

    /// call_stack to maintain proper creation context.
