//! Inspector management for TraceEvm
//!
//! This module provides inspector-specific functionality for the TraceEvm,
//! allowing access to trace data and inspector state management.

    /// Clone the inspector instance for trace analysis
    ///
    /// Creates a fresh copy of the current inspector. This is primarily used
    /// internally by the tracing system when calling `inspect_commit` functions,
    /// which require ownership of an inspector instance.
    ///
    /// # Design Rationale
    /// 
    /// In revm 24+, the new inspector architecture requires passing inspector
    /// instances by value to `inspect_commit` functions. This means:
    /// 
    /// - Each transaction trace needs its own inspector instance
    /// - The inspector must be cloned before being passed to `inspect_commit`
    /// - This ensures proper isolation between transaction traces
    /// 
    /// # Examples
    /// ```no_run
    /// use revm_trace::{create_evm_with_trace, TxInspector};
    /// 
    /// # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    /// let trace_inspector = TxInspector::new();
    /// let mut evm = create_evm_with_trace("https://eth.llamarpc.com", trace_inspector).await?;
    /// 
    /// // Clone inspector for external analysis
    /// let inspector_copy = evm.clone_inspector();
    /// 
    /// // The original inspector remains unchanged
    /// // while the copy can be used independently
    /// # Ok(())
    /// # }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A fresh copy of the inspector with the same configuration but
    /// independent state (reset to initial state).
    ///
    /// # Note
    /// This method is called internally during transaction processing to
    /// provide fresh inspector instances to `inspect_commit` functions.
    /// The `Clone` trait requirement ensures this operation is always available.
