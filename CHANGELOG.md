# [4.1.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **Global Storage Slot Change Tracking**: Simulation results now include a complete record of all storage slot changes (SlotAccess) for each transaction, enabling precise analysis of how contract state evolves during execution.
- **Per-CallTrace Slot Access Details**: Each CallTrace now records all slot accesses (reads and writes), with unified structure and type filtering (read/write/all), making it easy to audit every storage operation in the call tree.

### Use Cases
- **Security Analysis**: These features make it possible to reconstruct the full storage mutation history of any transaction, which is invaluable for analyzing hacker attacks, privilege escalations, and complex DeFi exploits.
- **Safe Wallet Auditing**: You can now inspect every storage read/write in Safe (Gnosis Safe) wallet transactions, helping to verify transaction intent and detect suspicious or unexpected state changes.

### Changed
- **API Change**: The return value of simulation functions has changed to include global slot change records. This is a breaking change for users relying on previous output formats.
- **CallTrace Structure**: CallTrace now contains a `slot_accesses` field, unifying slot read/write history for each call.

### Documentation
- Updated README and examples to demonstrate how to use the new slot tracking and analysis features for security and auditing scenarios.


## [4.0.2] - 2025-07-17

### Changed
- Documentation updated: Improved README and comments to clarify advanced usage, extensibility, and the core value of `TxInspector` and `TxTraceOutput`.

## [4.0.1] - 2025-7-17

### Added
- **NFT Support**: `TokenTransfer` now supports NFT transfers, including both ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
    - The `token_type` field distinguishes between ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and native tokens.
    - The `id` field records the tokenId for ERC721 and ERC1155 transfers.
- All transfer parsing and tracing APIs now handle ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and native asset transfers in a unified way.

### Changed
- `TokenTransfer` struct updated:
    - Added `token_type: TokenType` and `id: Option<U256>` fields.
    - Documentation and examples updated to reflect NFT support.


## [4.0.0] - 2025-06-24

### üöÄ Major Breaking Changes & Features

- **Unified Multi-Backend Support**: EVM simulation now supports both AlloyDB (default) and foundry-fork-db (via `foundry-fork` feature) with ergonomic, feature-conditional API.
- **EvmBuilder API**: All EVM construction is now via `EvmBuilder`, with `create_evm` and `create_evm_with_tracer` as quick entry points. Custom block height via builder or `set_db_block`.
- **Block Context Management**: All utility functions now manage block context at EVM creation; `block_env` removed from function signatures.
- **Multi-Threading & Concurrency**: Examples and API support robust multi-threaded and concurrent EVM simulation, including shared backend scenarios.
- **Trait-Based Reset & Caching**: New `ResetBlock` and `ResetDB` traits for block reset and cache management.
- **Improved Documentation**: README and doc comments rewritten for clarity, with new usage patterns, feature table, and a complete ERC20 transfer example.
- **Feature-Conditional Examples**: All examples modularized for backend selection via features.
- **Version Bump**: All version references updated to 4.0.0.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- All EVM construction and backend selection is now via `EvmBuilder` and feature flags.
- Utility functions no longer accept `block_env`; block context is set at EVM creation.
- API and example usage patterns have changed‚Äîsee README for migration guidance.
